Hello!
If you're here then you're likely from the Marc With a C discord!

Here is where I'll be hosting all the DIY assets for the Home Media Project, as well as any other MWAC related DIY art I create. (Like the J-cards for "The Best of Marc with a C?" playlist tapes.)

Music will not be hosted here. 
The music for the Home Media project is sourced exclusively from the MWAC Pateon Archive.

The music for "The Best of Marc with a C?" cassettes are from official releases, with the tracklist found on the discord spotify playlist, except for "I Hope You're Happy" which is found on both the Patreon Archive and is available for all in discord. (Marc posted it in there at one point, just do a search, you'll find it.

The music for "The Audience is Listening" is available on the Patreon Archive. The post you're looking for has the album "The Audience is Listening (Pop! Pop! Pop! Demos)".

The music for "Obscurity Deluxe" is in two parts. Side 1 is meant to be for the Offical Album as released by Marc. Side 2 is for the Obscurity Acoustic Demos, which you can get from the Patreon Archive.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING THE "OBSCURITY DELUXE" J-CARD
The J-Card for "Obscurity Deluxe" is double sided. To print properly, make sure that the PDF is CENTERED to the page. Once that prints, you will put the paper back into the tray (If it's a top loader, printed side down. If it's a tray loader, printed side up.) and print the other side.

All Hail The Great Squiddy!
