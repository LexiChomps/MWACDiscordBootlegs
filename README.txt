Hello!
If you're here then you're likely from the Marc With a C discord!

Here is where I'll be hosting all the DIY assets for the Home Media Project, as well as any other MWAC related DIY art I create. (Like the J-cards for "The Best of Marc with a C?" playlist tapes.)

Distinctions between the Home Media and Deluxe Albums projects.
Home Media intends to put as much of Marc's Patreon Archive on physical media as possible.
The Deluxe Albums project intends to present the original album alongside demos of songs from the albums and rarities such as live recordings and outtakes.
Home Media consists EXCLUSIVELY of unreleased material, making it suitable for production through services such as Kunaki. The Tracklists are run past Marc to ensure there are no possible issues with Needlejuice Records. (Don't sell your own copies, unless you're like selling your record collection idk. Like. Don't order a bunch and sell them. You'll get in trouble. Seriously. Also don't sell your record collection. Give it to your kids or something. If you don't have kids, give it to your Niece and Nephews IDK. If you're not an uncle or aunt give em to someone you know likes vinyl.)
The Deluxe Albums contain LICENSED MATERIAL. These are intended to be made by yourself and recorded to a tape deck. I will not make assets for vinyl releases. They will remain solely on Tape for home recording.

Music will not be hosted here. 
The music for the Home Media project is sourced exclusively from the MWAC Pateon Archive.

The music for "The Best of Marc with a C?" cassettes are from official releases, with the tracklist found on the discord spotify playlist, except for "I Hope You're Happy" which is found on both the Patreon Archive and is available for all in discord. (Marc posted it in there at one point, just do a search, you'll find it.

The music for "The Audience is Listening" is available on the Patreon Archive. The post you're looking for has the album "The Audience is Listening (Pop! Pop! Pop! Demos)".

The music for "Obscurity Deluxe" is in two parts. Side 1 is meant to be for the Offical Album as released by Marc. Side 2 is for the Obscurity Acoustic Demos, which you can get from the Patreon Archive.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING THE "OBSCURITY DELUXE" J-CARD
The J-Card for "Obscurity Deluxe" is double sided. To print properly, make sure that the PDF is CENTERED to the page. Once that prints, you will put the paper back into the tray (If it's a top loader, printed side down. If it's a tray loader, printed side up.) and print the other side.

All Hail The Great Squiddy!
