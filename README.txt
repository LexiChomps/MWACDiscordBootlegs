Hello!
If you're here then you're likely from the Marc With a C discord!

Here is where I'll be hosting all the DIY assets for the Home Media Project, as well as any other MWAC related DIY art I create. (Like the labels for "The Best of Marc with a C?" playlist tapes.)

Music will not be hosted here. 
The music for the Home Media project is sourced exclusively from the MWAC Pateon Archive.
The music for "The Best of Marc with a C?" cassettes are from official releases, with the tracklist found on the discord spotify playlist.

All Hail The Great Squiddy!
- Lexi <3
